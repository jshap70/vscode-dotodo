# vscode-dotodo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jshap70/vscode-todotodo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jshap70/vscode-todotodo)

This project is just a simple tree-like way of tracking TODOs/FIXMEs/NOTEs in a project using vscode's tree-like structures. It was honestly more of a playground for re-familiarizing myself with TypeScript than any kind of actual tool I intend to release, support, or even use.  

To be honest, VSCode's api documentation is both extensive and yet somehow lacking... It has a lot of the ideas, but because it's always changing to some extent it is a little tricky to look up specific details about it. At least, that was my own experience with it.
